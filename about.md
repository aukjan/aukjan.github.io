## Who I Am

I'm a technology leader who helps startups and scaleups navigate the critical transition from scrappy early-stage execution to structured, scalable operations. My unique perspective comes from dual experience as both CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and CPO (Chief Product Officer)—giving me the rare ability to bring the right amount of structure to both product and engineering organizations.

With 22+ years of leadership experience across growing companies, I specialize in helping organizations scale without over-engineering. My work focuses on introducing product structures, building engineering teams, and establishing operational frameworks that enable growth without sacrificing agility.
