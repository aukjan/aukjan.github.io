## Who I Am

I'm a technology leader who helps startups and scaleups navigate the critical transition from scrappy early-stage execution to structured, scalable operations. My unique perspective comes from dual experience as both CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and CPO (Chief Product Officer)—giving me the rare ability to bring the right amount of structure to both product and engineering organizations.

With 22+ years of leadership experience across growing companies, I specialize in helping organizations scale without over-engineering. My work focuses on introducing product structures, building engineering teams, and establishing operational frameworks that enable growth without sacrificing agility.

### My Journey

My career has taken me from engineering foundations at Eindhoven University of Technology to leadership roles in fast-growing companies across multiple markets. Along the way, I've learned what it takes to scale organizations effectively—building teams, launching products, and navigating the complex intersection of technology, business, and human needs.

**Current Focus:**
- Helping startups and scaleups introduce the right operational structures
- Building and scaling distributed engineering teams in growth-stage companies
- Establishing product frameworks that balance discovery with execution
- Bringing structure to both product and engineering organizations

## What Drives Me

I believe growing companies fail not from lack of ambition, but from introducing too much structure too early or too little structure too late. My approach focuses on finding the right balance:

- **Engineering Leadership**: Building teams in startups/scaleups that scale effectively—introducing process that enables rather than constrains
- **Product Strategy**: Right-sizing product operations for growth stage—balancing customer discovery, roadmap clarity, and execution velocity
- **Organizational Design**: Bringing operational maturity without over-engineering—helping teams grow from chaos to clarity
- **Strategic Alignment**: Connecting product and engineering structures to business objectives for measurable impact
