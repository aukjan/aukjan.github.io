## Always Open to Conversation

I genuinely enjoy connecting with fellow leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists. Whether you're navigating a growth challenge, exploring collaboration opportunities, or just want to exchange ideas about scaling organizations—I'd love to hear from you.

Despite spending over two decades in leadership roles, I remain deeply committed to staying accessible and approachable. Some of my best conversations have come from unexpected connections, and I believe in the value of open dialogue across the tech community.

**I'm especially interested in conversations about:**
- Scaling product and engineering organizations in startups and scaleups
- Bringing structure to growing companies without over-engineering
- Technology strategy and organizational design challenges
- Speaking opportunities and thought leadership collaboration
- Advisory roles and strategic consulting engagements

## Response Expectations

I make it a priority to read and respond to all genuine connection requests and inquiries. While my schedule can be demanding, I typically respond within 3-5 business days.

For time-sensitive matters or urgent collaboration opportunities, mention that in your initial message and I'll prioritize accordingly.

**A note on my approach:** I value meaningful conversations over transactional networking. Whether you're a founder seeking advice, a fellow leader exploring collaboration, or someone with an interesting challenge—if there's substance to discuss, I'm interested in talking.
