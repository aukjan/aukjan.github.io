So .. your outlook won’t start, what to do? Most likely it's database is corrupted. to fix:

1. Start outlook while holding down the `option` (alt) key. This brings up the ‘Microsoft Database Utility’.
2. Select the correct identity (probably Main Identity).
3. Now press the `Rebuild` button. 
4. Wait until completed, and start Outlook normally.
