## The Context

[Placeholder: Joined company post-acquisition to integrate acquired legacy product. Codebase accumulated 8+ years of technical debt. Test coverage below 20%. Deployment process manual and error-prone. Engineering morale low due to constant firefighting. New parent company considering sunset vs. modernization.]

## The Challenge

[Placeholder: Massive technical debt across infrastructure, code quality, and processes. Business pressure to integrate with parent company systems quickly. Engineering team burned out and skeptical of "yet another improvement initiative." No clear inventory of debt or prioritization framework. Can't stop feature development to fix everything.]

## Your Approach

[Placeholder: Conducted comprehensive technical debt audit with team input. Created debt inventory with business impact scoring. Implemented "boy scout rule"—leave code better than you found it. Allocated 20% of every sprint to debt reduction. Automated high-pain manual processes first. Celebrated small wins to build momentum and morale.]

## Key Decisions

[Placeholder: Key decision 1 - Focus on incremental improvement vs. big-bang rewrite. Key decision 2 - Make technical debt visible to product and business stakeholders. Key decision 3 - Implement automated testing as prerequisite for any new feature work.]

## The Outcome

[Placeholder: 18 months later - Test coverage improved to 75%. Deployment time reduced from 4 hours to 15 minutes. Production incidents decreased 70%. Team velocity actually increased despite debt paydown. Engineering satisfaction scores improved significantly. Product chosen for continued investment vs. sunset.]

## What You Learned

[Placeholder: Technical debt is a business problem, not just an engineering problem. Visibility and measurement enable prioritization. Small consistent improvements beat heroic efforts. Team morale affects everything—fix culture alongside code. Automation is force multiplier for small teams.]
