## The Context

[Placeholder: Describe joining an e-commerce startup experiencing rapid growth. Company had just closed Series B, user base growing 20% month-over-month, but infrastructure couldn't keep up. Frequent outages affecting revenue and customer trust. Board pressuring for reliability while maintaining growth trajectory.]

## The Challenge

[Placeholder: Monolithic architecture hitting scaling limits. Database becoming bottleneck. Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue. Engineering team spending 60% of time on incidents vs. new features. Pressure to scale quickly without massive rewrite that would stall product development for 6+ months.]

## Your Approach

[Placeholder: Decided on incremental modernization strategy rather than full rewrite. Identified critical bottlenecks through data analysis. Prioritized high-impact, low-risk improvements. Split monolith gradually using strangler fig pattern. Implemented observability first to make informed decisions. Aligned engineering and product on delivery cadence during transition.]

## Key Decisions

[Placeholder: Key decision 1 - Chose managed services (RDS, ElastiCache) over self-hosting to reduce operational burden. Key decision 2 - Implemented feature flags and progressive rollouts to mitigate risk. Key decision 3 - Paused non-critical features for one quarter to focus team on platform stability—hard sell to stakeholders but necessary.]

## The Outcome

[Placeholder: 9 months later - 99.9% uptime achieved, infrastructure costs reduced 40% through optimization, page load times improved 60%, engineering velocity doubled, team morale significantly improved, positioned company for next stage of growth.]

## What You Learned

[Placeholder: Technical problems are usually organizational problems in disguise. Alignment between engineering and product is critical. Incremental progress beats big-bang rewrites. Observability enables good decisions. Sometimes you have to slow down to speed up.]
