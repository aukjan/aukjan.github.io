## The Context

[Placeholder: Two-sided marketplace with healthy demand but supply-constrained. Buyer wait times increasing due to seller shortage. Competitive marketplaces aggressively recruiting sellers. Quality concerns preventing opening floodgates. Need 10x seller growth without compromising marketplace quality or trust.]

## The Challenge

[Placeholder: Classic chicken-and-egg marketplace problem tilted toward supply shortage. Vetting process manual and slow. No clear onboarding path for new sellers. Seller acquisition cost too high for unit economics. Existing sellers had inconsistent success—some thriving, many churning. Quality vs. quantity tension.]

## Your Approach

[Placeholder: Analyzed successful vs. churned sellers to identify success patterns. Built seller scorecard and quality framework. Automated portions of vetting process. Created self-service onboarding with progressive trust levels. Designed seller success playbook based on top performers. Implemented referral program incentivizing quality sellers to bring peers.]

## Key Decisions

[Placeholder: Key decision 1 - Built algorithmic quality scoring vs. manual review for scale. Key decision 2 - Created tiered seller system (bronze/silver/gold) with progressive benefits. Key decision 3 - Invested in seller education and success tooling vs. just acquisition.]

## The Outcome

[Placeholder: 12 months later - Active sellers grew 10x (500 → 5,000). Average seller revenue increased 30% through better tooling. Buyer satisfaction remained stable despite 10x supply growth. Seller acquisition cost reduced 50% through referral program. Quality scoring system became platform differentiator. Marketplace liquidity dramatically improved.]

## What You Learned

[Placeholder: Marketplace growth requires both sides—supply without demand fails. Quality frameworks enable sustainable scale. Seller success drives marketplace success. Automation enables scale, but human judgment still matters. Network effects compound when both sides thrive.]
