## The Context

[Placeholder: Consumer marketplace struggling with user acquisition and retention. Burn rate concerning investors. Initial target market (college students) not converting. User research showing different segment finding unexpected value. 6 months runway remaining—pivot or perish decision time.]

## The Challenge

[Placeholder: Core product assumption wrong—students wanted marketplace but weren't willing to pay. Different user segment (young professionals) using product in unintended way with higher engagement. Fear of alienating existing small user base. Engineering had just built features for college market. Need to move fast but validate before full pivot.]

## Your Approach

[Placeholder: Conducted intensive user research with high-engagement users. Built minimal feature set targeting new segment. Ran controlled experiment with both markets simultaneously. Used data to validate assumptions quickly. Aligned team and investors on pivot rationale. Created phased transition plan minimizing disruption.]

## Key Decisions

[Placeholder: Key decision 1 - Made data-driven bet on young professional segment vs. original college market. Key decision 2 - Deprecated features serving original market to focus resources. Key decision 3 - Repriced product for new segment's willingness to pay (3x higher).]

## The Outcome

[Placeholder: 6 months post-pivot - Monthly active users grew 5x. Revenue per user increased 4x. Retention improved from 15% to 60% month-over-month. Raised Series A on strength of new traction. Product-market fit metrics achieved. Team energized by clear direction and growth.]

## What You Learned

[Placeholder: Product-market fit is discovered, not designed. Watch what users do, not what they say. Kill your darlings—features serving old market prevented focus. Speed of validation matters more than perfection. Clear metrics enable confident pivots. Team alignment requires transparent data sharing.]
