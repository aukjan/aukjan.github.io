## The Context

[Placeholder: Enterprise B2B product powerful but notoriously difficult to use. Customers requesting extensive training for new users. High support ticket volume related to UI confusion. Competitive products gaining ground with better UX. Customer churn analysis showed poor initial experience driving cancellations.]

## The Challenge

[Placeholder: Complex product built incrementally over 5 years without UX vision. Different features designed by different teams with inconsistent patterns. Resistance from power users who mastered current interface. Engineering skeptical of "just cosmetic changes." Need to modernize without disrupting existing workflows.]

## Your Approach

[Placeholder: Hired first dedicated UX researcher to understand user journeys. Conducted extensive usability testing with new and experienced users. Created unified design system across product. Implemented progressive disclosure for advanced features. Built onboarding flow based on user research. Rolled out changes gradually with opt-in beta period.]

## Key Decisions

[Placeholder: Key decision 1 - Invested in proper UX research vs. designing based on assumptions. Key decision 2 - Created design system before rebuilding features to ensure consistency. Key decision 3 - Gave power users early access and incorporated feedback to prevent backlash.]

## The Outcome

[Placeholder: 9 months later - New user onboarding time reduced 60% (4 hours → 90 minutes). Feature adoption increased 45%. Support ticket volume decreased 35%. Customer satisfaction scores improved significantly. Design system enabled faster feature development. Sales using improved UX as competitive advantage.]

## What You Learned

[Placeholder: UX debt compounds like technical debt. User research prevents expensive mistakes. Design systems pay dividends beyond initial investment. Change management matters—bring users along journey. Good UX isn't cosmetic, it's fundamental to product success.]
