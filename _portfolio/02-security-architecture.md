## The Context

[Placeholder: Enterprise SaaS company needed to move upmarket to enterprise customers. Security posture inadequate for enterprise deals. Sales losing deals due to security concerns. Board mandated SOC 2 compliance within 12 months. Existing architecture built for speed, not enterprise security requirements.]

## The Challenge

[Placeholder: 50+ microservices with inconsistent security practices. No centralized identity management. Audit logs scattered across systems. Compliance requirements affecting every team. Engineering resistance to "slowing down" for security. Need to achieve certification without grinding product development to halt.]

## Your Approach

[Placeholder: Formed dedicated security working group with representatives from each team. Conducted comprehensive security audit to identify gaps. Built centralized authentication and authorization system. Implemented gradual migration path with clear milestones. Created security champions program within engineering teams. Made security part of definition of done.]

## Key Decisions

[Placeholder: Key decision 1 - Invested in security tooling and automation vs. manual processes. Key decision 2 - Made security a product requirement, not a separate workstream. Key decision 3 - Hired fractional CISO to guide certification process rather than learning as we go.]

## The Outcome

[Placeholder: SOC 2 Type II certified in 10 months. Zero-trust architecture implemented across all services. Security incident response time reduced 80%. Enterprise sales pipeline grew 3x post-certification. Created repeatable security patterns for future services. Team learned security is everyone's responsibility.]

## What You Learned

[Placeholder: Security can't be bolted on—it must be built in from the start. Compliance certifications accelerate good engineering practices. Culture change requires both top-down mandate and bottom-up champions. Investment in tooling pays for itself quickly. Security and velocity aren't opposites when done right.]
