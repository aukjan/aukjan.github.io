|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-08 | Keep Jekyll + GitHub Pages | Existing infrastructure works, free hosting, no migration complexity |
| 2026-01-08 | YOLO mode | Fast iteration preferred over approval gates |
| 2026-01-08 | Standard depth | Balanced planning (6 phases) appropriate for site transformation |

## Open Issues

None yet - project just initialized.

## Next Steps

1. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create detailed execution plan for Foundation & Cleanup
2. Alternative: `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` to gather more context first
3. Alternative: `/gsd:research-phase 1` to investigate GitHub Actions and Jekyll best practices
