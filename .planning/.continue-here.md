# Work State: Between Phase 4 and Phase 5

## Current Position

**Just Completed:** Phase 4 - Portfolio & Case Studies ✅ (100% complete, 3/3 plans)
**Next Up:** Phase 5 - Thought Leadership Platform (0% complete, needs planning)

### What You'll Find When You Return

This is a **clean transition point** between phases. Phase 4 is fully complete and committed. No work in progress, no uncommitted code changes. Perfect state to start Phase 5 planning.

**Uncommitted planning files** in `.planning/phases/04-portfolio-case-studies/`:
- `phase4-CONTEXT.md` - Vision document from discuss-phase
- `phase4-RESEARCH.md` - Research findings for timeline and case studies
- `phase4-timeline-PLAN.md` - Plan 1 (executed)
- `phase4-case-studies-PLAN.md` - Plan 2 (executed)
- `phase4-navigation-PLAN.md` - Plan 3 (executed)

These can be committed now if desired, but they're documentation artifacts (not blocking work).

## Phase 4 Complete Summary

### What Was Built (19 commits total)

**Timeline Infrastructure (phase4-timeline):**
- Jekyll `_portfolio` collection configured with clean URLs
- 260-line CSS timeline component (vertical layout, alternating cards)

- 6 commits (5 features/tests + 1 docs)

**Content Structure (phase4-case-studies):**
- Portfolio layout template (`_layouts/portfolio.html`)
- 130 lines of case study styles in `_sass/_components.scss`
- 7 placeholder case studies (4 technical, 3 product)
- 6-part case study framework (Context → Challenge → Approach → Decisions → Outcome → Learned)
- Projects span 2020-2023 showing career progression
- Product/technical split: 43%/57%
- 4 commits (3 features + 1 docs)

**Navigation & SEO (phase4-navigation):**

- Generic contexts maintain confidentiality

## Phase 5 Planning Context

### What Phase 5 Is About

**Goal:** Create content platform for articles and thought leadership

**Why Now:** Foundation, design system, core pages, and portfolio all complete. Ready to establish industry voice through articles and insights.

**Likely Deliverables:**
- Enhanced article template optimized for readability
- Archive page improvements (currently basic list)
- Article categorization/tagging system
- RSS/Atom feed optimization
- Potential newsletter integration
- Article series or collection grouping
- Featured/pinned article capability
- Author bio integration
- Reading time estimates
- Social sharing improvements

### Current Article System State

**What Exists:**
- Jekyll posts in `_posts/` directory
- Basic archive page at `/archive/` (list of all posts)
- Post layout (`_layouts/post.html`)
- 3 existing blog posts from 2017

**What Needs Enhancement:**
- Article template is basic (needs better typography, spacing)
- Archive page is bare-bones (simple list)
- No categorization or tagging visible
- No featured images or hero sections
- No reading time estimates
- Limited social sharing optimization
- RSS feed exists but not highlighted

### Key Questions to Answer in Phase 5 Planning

1. **Content Organization:**
   - Keep simple chronological archive, or add categories/tags?
   - Should articles have featured images?
   - Need article series or collections?

2. **Thought Leadership Focus:**
   - What makes this different from portfolio case studies?
   - Should emphasize industry commentary vs. project stories?
   - Need different article types (deep dives, quick takes, etc.)?

3. **Reader Experience:**
   - Reading time estimates useful?
   - Need better article metadata (publish date, update date, reading time)?
   - Social sharing buttons on articles?
   - Related articles section?

4. **Content Discovery:**
   - How should readers find older content?
   - Category pages? Tag clouds? Search?
   - Featured/pinned articles on homepage?

5. **Syndication:**
   - Promote RSS/Atom feed more prominently?
   - Newsletter integration (Substack, ConvertKit, etc.)?
   - Cross-posting strategy (Medium, LinkedIn, Dev.to)?

## Recommended Next Actions

### Option A: Start with Vision Discussion (Recommended)

```bash
/gsd:discuss-phase 5
```

This will ask collaborative questions to clarify:
- Article template enhancements vs. archive improvements
- Categorization strategy (if any)
- Newsletter/syndication plans
- Featured content approach
- Balance between depth and simplicity

Creates: `phase5-CONTEXT.md`

### Option B: Research First

```bash
/gsd:research-phase 5
```

Research best practices for:
- Modern article templates (typography, spacing, readability)
- Content organization (categories, tags, series)
- Newsletter integration options
- RSS feed optimization
- Social sharing patterns

Creates: `phase5-RESEARCH.md`

### Option C: Jump to Planning (Skip Context)

```bash
/gsd:plan-phase 5
```

Create executable plans based on Claude's assumptions. Less collaborative but faster if vision is clear.

Creates: Multiple `phase5-*-PLAN.md` files

### Option D: Check Full Status First

```bash
/gsd:progress
```

Review complete project state, recent work, and get smart routing to next action.

## Mental Context for Resumption

### Project Vibe

This is a **personal branding site transformation**. Started as basic Jekyll blog, now becoming modern professional portfolio site. The approach:

- **Professional but approachable** - not corporate, not casual
- **Demonstrates range** - both product AND technical depth
- **Shows versatility** - diverse contexts (seed → Series C, marketplaces → enterprise SaaS)
- **Right-sized structure** - philosophy of bringing appropriate structure to growing companies
- **Startup/scaleup focus** - not enterprise CTO, focused on growth-stage leadership

### Execution Pattern

Using **YOLO mode** throughout:
- Plans execute autonomously without approval gates
- Each task gets atomic commit immediately after completion
- Testing and verification built into plans
- Documentation updated as part of execution
- Fast iteration, trust the process

### Design System Maturity

Foundation is **solid and comprehensive**:
- 87 CSS custom properties (design tokens)
- Complete component library (cards, buttons, badges, forms)
- Typography system (Montserrat headings + Merriweather body)
- Responsive utilities (mobile-first, 4 breakpoints)
- Timeline component (260 lines, battle-tested)
- Accessibility baked in (WCAG 2.1 AA throughout)

New components for Phase 5 should integrate seamlessly.

### Content Philosophy

**Portfolio vs. Articles distinction:**
- **Portfolio** = project case studies, demonstrating work, "proof of capability"
- **Articles** = thought leadership, industry insights, "proof of thinking"

Phase 5 should establish voice and perspective, not just list projects.

## Technical Context

### Stack
- Jekyll 4.3.x static site generator
- GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions
- Sass/SCSS for styling (7 partials + main.scss)
- Liquid templating for dynamic content
- Docker for local development (bundle exec has issues)

### Key Files to Know
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration (collections, plugins, metadata)
- `_layouts/` - Page templates (default, page, post, portfolio)
- `_includes/` - Reusable components (header, footer, head)
- `_sass/` - Design system (tokens, components, layouts, utilities)
- `assets/css/main.scss` - CSS entry point (imports partials)
- `.planning/` - GSD workflow (STATE, ROADMAP, PROJECT, phases)

### Build Commands
```bash
# Local development (preferred)
docker-compose up

# Alternative (if Docker not available)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Clean build
bundle exec jekyll clean
bundle exec jekyll build
```

### Verification Pattern
All Phase 4 plans included comprehensive testing:
- Accessibility checks (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast)
- Responsive checks (desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints)
- Functional checks (links, navigation, builds)
- SEO checks (meta tags, structured data, sitemap)

Continue this pattern in Phase 5.

## First Action When Resuming

**Recommended flow:**

1. **Orient yourself:**
   ```bash
   /gsd:progress
   ```
   This will show you current position, recent work, and smart routing to next action.

2. **If you want to shape Phase 5 vision:**
   ```bash
   /gsd:discuss-phase 5
   ```
   Collaborative questions to clarify direction before planning.

3. **If you're ready to plan:**
   ```bash
   /gsd:plan-phase 5
   ```
   Create executable plans for Thought Leadership Platform phase.

**Don't forget:** This project uses YOLO mode, so once you start executing, it will proceed autonomously. Review plans before execution if you want to shape the approach.
