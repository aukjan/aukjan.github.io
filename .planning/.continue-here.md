## Phase 5 Planning Context

### What Phase 5 Is About

**Goal:** Create content platform for articles and thought leadership

**Why Now:** Foundation, design system, core pages, and portfolio all complete. Homepage aligned with LinkedIn. Ready to establish industry voice through articles.

**Current Article System:**
- Jekyll posts in `_posts/` directory
- Basic archive page at `/archive/`
- Post layout exists (`_layouts/post.html`)
- 3 existing blog posts from 2017

**Potential Enhancements:**
- Enhanced article template (better typography, readability)
- Archive page improvements
- Article categorization/tagging
- RSS/Atom feed optimization
- Newsletter integration possibility
- Featured articles
- Reading time estimates
- Social sharing optimization

### Key Considerations for Phase 5

Given the current "homepage only" approach from Phase 4.2, Phase 5 planning should consider:

1. **Is the article/blog system still relevant?**
   - Does this fit with the simplified site approach?
   - Or should articles be on Medium/LinkedIn instead?

2. **If keeping articles:**
   - How do they integrate with homepage-only nav?
   - Featured article on homepage?
   - External blog links?

3. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Skip Phase 5 and go to Phase 6 (Polish & Launch)?
   - Defer articles to post-launch?
   - External content strategy only?

## What Makes This Handoff Special

You're joining at a **transition point** after completing homepage alignment:
- ✅ Phase 4.2 just completed
- ✅ Homepage now aligned with LinkedIn
- ✅ Site simplified to homepage only
- ✅ No work in progress
- ✅ Clean commit history
- 🤔 Phase 5 direction needs discussion
- 🎯 Consider if article system still fits current approach
- 🎯 Or skip to Phase 6 (Polish & Launch)

## First Action When Resuming

**Recommended flow:**

1. **Review the approach:**
   - Given "homepage only" simplification in Phase 4.2
   - Does Phase 5 (Thought Leadership Platform) still make sense?
   - Or should we skip to Phase 6 (Polish & Launch)?

2. **If proceeding with Phase 5:**
   ```bash
   /gsd:discuss-phase 5
   ```
   Discuss how articles fit with simplified site approach

3. **If skipping to Phase 6:**
   ```bash
   /gsd:discuss-phase 6
   ```
   Jump to polish and launch

4. **If unsure:**
   ```bash
   /gsd:progress
   ```
   Review full project status and get guidance

## Open Question for Next Session

**Phase 5 Relevance:** Given the Phase 4.2 decision to simplify to "homepage only" with no internal navigation, does it make sense to build out an article/blog platform? Options:

A. **Proceed with Phase 5** - Add article system despite simplified nav
   - Could link articles from homepage as featured content
   - External blog approach (link to Medium/LinkedIn articles)

B. **Skip Phase 5** - Go directly to Phase 6 (Polish & Launch)
   - Site is essentially complete as homepage-focused
   - Articles can be post-launch addition

C. **Modify Phase 5** - Different approach to thought leadership
   - Featured articles section on homepage
   - Links to external content (Medium, LinkedIn)
   - No separate article pages needed

This decision should be made at the start of next session.

**Status:** ✅ Clean handoff - Phase 4.2 complete, Phase 5 direction needs clarification
**Last commit:** `9363ff9` - feat(navigation): remove all internal page links
