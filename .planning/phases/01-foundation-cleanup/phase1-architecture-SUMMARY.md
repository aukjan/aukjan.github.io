# Phase 1 Plan 2 Summary: Architecture Resolution & Dependencies

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

## Objective Achieved

Successfully resolved dual architecture confusion, established Jekyll as single source of truth, and added proper dependency management. Site now has consistent architecture foundation for future development.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Resolve Dual Architecture ✅
**Commit:** `9658e45`

**Actions:**
- Backed up standalone index.html content
- Created design-notes.md in Phase 2 planning to preserve color palette and layout patterns
- Replaced standalone index.html with Jekyll-based temporary homepage using `layout: default`
- Removed standalone styles.css from root
- Verified all pages now use Jekyll front matter

**Outcome:** Jekyll is now single architecture. No competing standalone HTML/CSS. Clean foundation for Phase 2 redesign.

### Task 2: Create Gemfile for Dependency Management ✅
**Commit:** `1152eaa`

**Actions:**
- Created Gemfile with github-pages gem (~> 231) for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Listed jekyll-paginate plugin explicitly
- Added webrick gem for Ruby 3.0+ support
- Verified plugins match _config.yml configuration
- Note: Gemfile.lock will be generated by GitHub Actions (local Ruby 2.6 incompatible)

**Outcome:** Reproducible builds with pinned versions. Better local development experience. Ensures GitHub Pages compatibility.

### Task 3: Clean Up Development Utilities ✅
**Commit:** `5f22e1a`

**Actions:**
- Verified preview.py already tracked in git
- Created comprehensive README.md with:
  - Project description and purpose
  - Local development instructions (bundle exec jekyll serve)
  - Alternative preview server option (preview.py)
  - Project structure overview
  - Deployment information
- Updated .gitignore to include .jekyll-cache and Gemfile.lock

**Outcome:** Clear development documentation. Proper gitignore configuration for Jekyll artifacts.

### Task 4: Verify Single Architecture ✅
**No separate commit** (verification task)

**Actions:**
- Verified all content pages use Jekyll layouts with YAML front matter:
  - index.html → layout: default
  - about.md → layout: page
  - archive.md → layout: page
  - 404.html → layout: default
- Confirmed no standalone HTML files remain
- Verified styles.css removed from root

**Outcome:** Consistent Jekyll architecture across entire site. All pages use template hierarchy.

### Task 5: Document Architecture Decision ✅
**Commit:** `0b63a02`

**Actions:**
- Updated .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table
- Marked "Jekyll as single architecture" as complete (2026-01-08)
- Added "Use Gemfile for dependencies" decision
- Updated status of infrastructure decisions
- Documented rationale and outcomes

**Outcome:** Architecture decision properly recorded in project documentation.

## Verification Results

All automated checks passed (manual verification):

✅ **Gemfile exists** with pinned versions
✅ **No standalone styles.css** in root directory
✅ **index.html uses Jekyll** (has YAML front matter)
✅ **All pages use Jekyll layouts** (index, about, archive, 404)
✅ **Consistent architecture** across site
✅ **README documentation** complete with dev instructions
✅ **.gitignore configured** for Jekyll artifacts

## Files Modified

**Created:**
- Gemfile (dependency management)
- README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- .planning/phases/02-design-system-architecture/design-notes.md (preserve design for Phase 2)

**Modified:**
- index.html (standalone → Jekyll-based temporary homepage)
- .gitignore (added .jekyll-cache, Gemfile.lock)
- .planning/PROJECT.md (documented decisions)

**Removed:**
- styles.css (standalone CSS file)

**Preserved:**
- index.html.backup (not committed, local reference only)

## Outcomes & Impact

**Architecture Clarity:** ⬆️ Significantly Improved
- Single Jekyll architecture established
- No competing systems
- Clear template hierarchy
- Consistent development approach

**Developer Experience:** ⬆️ Enhanced
- Gemfile enables reproducible builds
- Comprehensive README documentation
- Clear local development workflow
- Proper dependency management

**Project Foundation:** ⬆️ Solid
- Ready for Phase 2 design system
- No architecture confusion
- Jekyll infrastructure leveraged fully
- GitHub Pages compatibility ensured

## Deviations from Plan

**Minor Enhancement:**
- Created design-notes.md to preserve standalone design elements for Phase 2 (not in original plan but valuable for continuity)
- Added Gemfile.lock to .gitignore (sensible addition for CI-generated files)

No blockers or issues encountered.

## Design Preservation

Preserved from standalone architecture for Phase 2:
- Color palette (blue gradient: #1e3c72 → #2a5298)
- Typography (Roboto, large hero text)
- Layout patterns (centered cards, grid layouts)
- Modern, professional aesthetic
- See: `.planning/phases/02-design-system-architecture/design-notes.md`

## Next Steps

**Ready for:** Phase 1 Plan 3 - GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

**Next Plan:** `.planning/phases/01-foundation-cleanup/phase1-cicd-PLAN.md`

**Focus:** Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated Jekyll builds and GitHub Pages deployment. Replace legacy auto-build with explicit CI/CD pipeline.
