# Phase 2 Context: Design System & Architecture

**Vision gathered:** 2026-01-08

## How This Phase Works

Replace the dated Lanyon theme with a modern, professional design system that establishes the visual foundation for the entire site.

**Design Approach:**
- Create HTML/CSS prototypes in the repository that can evolve into real implementation
- Validate design direction through working examples before committing to final templates
- Establish design language (colors, fonts, spacing) alongside concrete demonstrations

**Target Feel:**
Professional but approachable - warm and inviting while maintaining executive credibility. Balanced between formal and friendly, showing personality without sacrificing professionalism.

## What's Essential for THIS Phase

**Core Outcome:**
Complete design with example pages - fully designed pages showing how the system works in practice, ready to fill with content in later phases.

**Design Characteristics:**
- **Readable, human-friendly typography**: Not overly formal fonts - conversational yet professional
- **Clear hierarchy without being rigid**: Well-organized but not sterile - guides the eye naturally
- **Personal touches and authenticity**: Room for personality to show through - space for photos, personal voice, human elements

**Format:**
HTML/CSS prototypes in the repo - build prototype pages directly in Jekyll that demonstrate the design and can evolve into the real site.

## What's Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT in this phase:**

❌ **Complex interactions or animations**
- Keep it simple - no fancy hover effects, transitions, or interactive elements yet
- Focus on solid foundation, not flourishes

❌ **SEO and performance optimization**
- That's for the polish phase
- Focus purely on design and visual foundation

**Deferred to later phases:**
- Writing actual content (bio, case studies, articles) - Phase 3+
- Final performance tuning - Phase 6
- Advanced interactions - Future enhancement

## Design Deliverables

1. **Visual Foundation**
   - Modern color palette (not corporate gray - some personality)
   - Typography system (readable, approachable)
   - Spacing and layout principles

2. **Component Library**
   - Headers, navigation, footer
   - Cards and content blocks
   - Responsive layout framework

3. **Working Examples**
   - Prototype pages demonstrating the design in action
   - Example layouts for key page types
   - Shows how content will look and feel

4. **Jekyll Integration**
   - Base layout replacing Lanyon theme
   - Reusable includes/components
   - Mobile-first responsive CSS

## Success Looks Like

- Site has a modern, professional aesthetic reflecting C-level positioning
- Design feels warm and approachable, not sterile or corporate
- Clear visual hierarchy that guides naturally
- Prototype pages demonstrate the system working
- Ready to fill with actual content in Phase 3
- Foundation is flexible enough for all planned page types

## References

**Design preserved from Phase 1:**
- `.planning/phases/02-design-system-architecture/design-notes.md` - Color palette and layout patterns from old standalone design (for reference, not necessarily to use)

**Existing theme:**
- Current Lanyon theme files in `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `public/css/`
- To be replaced/evolved, not just tweaked

*This phase sets the visual tone for the entire portfolio. Get this right, and content pages will flow naturally in Phase 3.*
