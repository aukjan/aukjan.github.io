# Phase 4.2 Context: Align Homepage with LinkedIn Profile

## Vision

Update the homepage to accurately reflect and align with the current LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/aukjan/

The LinkedIn profile has evolved and is more current than the site. This phase ensures consistency so that someone moving from LinkedIn to the site experiences a coherent, unified professional presence.

## How It Works

1. **Review LinkedIn Profile First**
   - Analyze current positioning and messaging on LinkedIn
   - Identify key expertise areas highlighted
   - Note tone, voice, and communication style
   - Understand current role focus and accomplishments

2. **Update Homepage Content**
   - Expertise sections to match LinkedIn capabilities
   - Tone and voice to match LinkedIn communication style
   - Ensure email (aukjan@vanbelkum.nl) is prominent and easy to find
   - May add new sections if needed to achieve alignment

3. **Maintain Design Consistency**
   - Keep existing design system (colors, fonts, components)
   - Work within or extend current homepage structure
   - Focus on content/messaging alignment, not visual redesign

## What's Essential

- **LinkedIn Profile Review**: Start by understanding the current LinkedIn positioning
- **Expertise Alignment**: Make sure expertise cards/areas match what's on LinkedIn
- **Tone Consistency**: The way you communicate on LinkedIn should match the site
- **Email Prominence**: aukjan@vanbelkum.nl should be easily findable
- **Content Freedom**: Open to meaningful content updates and adding sections if needed

## What's Out of Scope

- **Design System Changes**: No changes to colors, fonts, or visual design
- **Other Pages**: Focus is homepage only - About and Portfolio can be addressed later if needed
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Not changing Jekyll setup, plugins, or architecture

## Success Looks Like

- Someone reading your LinkedIn profile and then visiting the homepage feels continuity
- Expertise areas are consistent between both platforms
- Tone and voice feel unified across LinkedIn and the site
- Contact email is clear and prominent
- The homepage accurately represents your current professional positioning

## Why Now (Phase 4.2)

LinkedIn profile is more current than the site. Before moving forward with thought leadership platform (Phase 5) or launch activities (Phase 6), need to ensure the homepage accurately represents your current professional brand.
