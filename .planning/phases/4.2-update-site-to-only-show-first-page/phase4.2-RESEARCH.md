## Alignment Gaps Identified

### 1. **Missing "Builder" Identity**
- **Gap:** LinkedIn emphasizes "technologist and builder at heart, I spent the last 22 years building products"
- **Homepage:** Focuses on structure/leadership but not hands-on builder identity
- **Impact:** Visitors from LinkedIn may not recognize the same person

### 2. **Current Employer Not Mentioned**
- **Gap:** LinkedIn shows Pandora Intelligence as current role
- **Homepage:** Generic positioning without current context
- **Impact:** Site feels dated or disconnected from current work

### 3. **Cybersecurity/Threat Intelligence Missing**
- **Gap:** LinkedIn highlights "Cybersecurity and threat intelligence platforms" as key expertise
- **Homepage:** No mention of cybersecurity domain expertise
- **Impact:** Domain credibility not evident (note: Phase 3 intentionally repositioned away from cybersecurity as primary focus, but it should remain visible as domain expertise)

### 4. **Email Contact Not Visible**
- **Gap:** aukjan@vanbelkum.nl not displayed on homepage
- **Homepage:** Only LinkedIn link in CTA, no direct email
- **Impact:** Friction for direct outreach

### 5. **Tone/Voice Differences**
- **Gap:** LinkedIn = "humble, light-hearted, benevolent" + hands-on builder
- **Homepage:** More corporate/strategic, less personal
- **Impact:** Different personality impression

### 6. **Product Certifications Not Highlighted**
- **Gap:** LinkedIn shows recent product management credentials (2022)
- **Homepage:** Product expertise stated but not substantiated
- **Impact:** Missed credibility signal

## Recommended Alignment Strategy

### Content Updates

**1. Strengthen Builder Identity**
- Add "builder" language to hero or intro section
- Emphasize 22 years of hands-on product building
- Balance strategic positioning with hands-on credibility

**2. Add Current Context**
- Optional: Reference current work (if appropriate for public site)
- Or: Add "Building B2B threat intelligence platforms" as domain context
- Maintains freshness without being resume-like

**3. Restore Cybersecurity as Domain Expertise**
- Add 4th expertise card OR integrate into existing cards
- Frame as domain expertise, not primary positioning
- Example: "Deep domain expertise in cybersecurity and threat intelligence"

**4. Make Email Prominent**
- Add aukjan@vanbelkum.nl to homepage CTA section
- Consider adding to hero section as well
- Ensure it's easily copy-able (not just mailto link)

**5. Warm Up The Tone**
- Soften language to match LinkedIn's approachable style
- Add personality indicators ("builder at heart", collaborative language)
- Maintain professionalism while increasing warmth

**6. Consider Product Credentials**
- Optional: Add subtle credential mention
- Could be in expertise section or footer
- Avoid resume feel, but signal recent continued learning

### Structural Considerations

**Keep (Working Well):**
- Overall startup/scaleup positioning
- "Right amount of structure" philosophy
- Three expertise card structure
- Portfolio CTA
- Design system and visual hierarchy

**Modify (Alignment Needed):**
- Hero description (add builder identity)
- Intro paragraph (warmer tone, hands-on emphasis)
- Expertise cards (consider 4th card or integrate cybersecurity)
- CTA section (add prominent email)

**Add (Currently Missing):**
- Direct email contact
- Cybersecurity domain expertise visibility
- Builder/hands-on language
- Current context or recent work framing

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Content Review & Drafting
1. Read current homepage content sections
2. Review LinkedIn profile for exact language/phrasing
3. Draft updated copy maintaining existing structure
4. Ensure tone matches LinkedIn's approachable professionalism

### Phase 2: Strategic Updates
1. Update hero description (add builder identity)
2. Revise intro section (warmer tone, 22 years building)
3. Modify or add expertise card (cybersecurity domain)
4. Add email to CTA section

### Phase 3: Contact Prominence
1. Add aukjan@vanbelkum.nl to homepage
2. Make email easily findable and copy-able
3. Consider mailto link + visible text

### Phase 4: Verification
1. Side-by-side comparison: LinkedIn profile → Homepage
2. Check tone consistency
3. Verify expertise alignment
4. Confirm email visibility
5. Test from visitor perspective (LinkedIn → site continuity)

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Current Employer Mention
**Options:**
- A: Add "Currently building B2B threat intelligence at Pandora Intelligence"
- B: Generic framing: "Currently focused on B2B threat intelligence platforms"
- C: No current role mention (keep generic positioning)

**Recommendation:** Option B - provides freshness and domain context without being resume-like

### Decision 2: Cybersecurity Positioning
**Options:**
- A: Add 4th expertise card specifically for cybersecurity
- B: Integrate into existing "Growth-Stage Structure" card
- C: Add as subtext in intro section

**Recommendation:** Option C - mention in intro as domain expertise ("with deep roots in cybersecurity and threat intelligence") to avoid conflicting with Phase 3's intentional repositioning

### Decision 3: Email Placement
**Options:**
- A: Hero section (most prominent)
- B: CTA section only
- C: Both hero and CTA

**Recommendation:** Option B initially - CTA section with clear visibility. Can add to hero if needed.

### Decision 4: Tone Adjustment Depth
**Options:**
- A: Minimal - just soften a few phrases
- B: Moderate - rewrite intro and hero to be warmer
- C: Comprehensive - rewrite all copy with LinkedIn tone

**Recommendation:** Option B - focused rewrite of hero and intro sections for maximum impact with minimal scope
